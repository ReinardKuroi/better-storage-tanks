# Better Storage Tanks

**Version:0.1.1**

**Short description:**

Factorio mod that allows picking up storage tanks without dumping their contents.

**Long description:**

In vanilla, when you mine a storage tank, you just get the storage tank. Whatever liquid was inside it is lost, spilled on the ground and evaporated. Or not, who knows. This mod allows your character to pick up the storage tank and all of it's contents, and then place it somewhere else, like the allmighty strongman he is.
